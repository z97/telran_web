<h1>Elephant</h1>
<p><b>Elephants</b> are <strong>mammals</strong> of the family Elephantidae and the largest existing land animals. Three species are currently
    recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. Elephantidae is the only
    surviving <i>family</i> of the order <em>Proboscidea</em>; extinct members include the mastodons. The family Elephantidae also
    contains several now-extinct groups, including the mammoths and straight-tusked elephants. African elephants have
    larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears, and convex or level backs. Distinctive
    features of all elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, massive legs, and tough
    but sensitive skin. The trunk is used for breathing, bringing food and water to the mouth, and grasping objects.
    Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging.
    The large ear flaps assist in <span id="probo">maintaining</span> a constant body temperature as well as in communication. The pillar-like
    legs carry their great weight. </p>
